Ideological realism was an artistic movement in 19th century Russia, including groups like the Peredvizhniki.
Ideological realism is also a name for a literary current that reached its zenith in the 19th century. It was very much like realism, but ideological realism tried to deliver an ideological message to the reader, in addition to staying close to reality. Famous writers that can be described as ideological realists include Charles Dickens and Dutch poet Jacob Cats.

The House in Nightmare Park
The House in Nightmare Park (known as "Crazy House" in the U.S.) is a 1973 British comedy horror film directed by Peter Sykes and starring Frankie Howerd, Ray Milland and Hugh Burden. It was one of a number of British comedy films which parodied the successful British horror genre, closely associated with the Hammer Horror films. Its plot follows that of a traditional "Old Dark House" story.


== Plot ==
Struggling actor Foster Twelvetrees (Frankie Howerd) is invited to a large country home by Stewart Henderson (Ray Milland) to perform a dramatic reading for his family. Outwardly, Stewart is complimentary and enthusiastic, but his more sinister intentions were made clear when earlier he secretly sliced a poster of Twelvetrees. Whilst they chat, Stewart's sister Jessica (Rosalie Crutchley) and their Indian servant Patel (John Bennett) begin searching through Twelvetrees' luggage. Twelvetrees nevertheless responds with an unintentional wit and bumbling characteristic throughout the rest of the film.
After they send him to bed, Stewart and Jessica talk cryptically about not being able to find something in his luggage and concluding he must have it elsewhere. Later on Twelvetrees is chided by Stewart for nearly walking in on a restricted room – Stewart explains his ill brother Victor is in there. Then during his sleep Twelvetrees is woken to a commotion downstairs: Stewart's other brother Reggie (Hugh Burden) and his daughter Verity (Elizabeth MacLennan) have arrived with Reggie demanding his regular allowance from Victor. Spying on the proceedings Twelvetrees spots Stewart going elsewhere to see his mother. The next day, after being introduced to a snake house underground, Twelvetrees secretly goes upstairs to see Stewart's mother: though kept behind a locked door she initially seems extremely polite and explains her family's history of theatrics in India. Suddenly, she tries to kill Twelvetrees with a knife but he is saved by Patel – the servant explains her presence there is secret lest she be taken away. Though very unnerved, Stewart persuades Twelvetrees to stay to perform that evening.
Before doing so another brother arrives; Ernest (Kenneth Griffith) and his wife Aggie arrive to demand his regular allowance – both he and Reggie have found their cheques from Victor have been bouncing. Suspicious that Stewart is trying to change Victor's will to his favour, Reggie and Ernest resolve to stay and make sure that doesn't happen. In the meantime, Verity persuades Twelvetrees to check up on Victor, and to their shock discover the bed in his room is filled by a dummy. Confronted, Stewart tells Reggie and Ernest that Victor is dead and reveals another secret: Twelvetrees is in fact Victor's secret son and that he is entitled to everything in Victor's will. Plus, Stewart is convinced Twelvetrees unknowingly has a clue to where a batch of diamonds are hidden on the estate. Ernest and Aggie, after their own search, are convinced they've found the clue is a framed misquoted motto and plan to kill Twelvetrees with poison: Stewart foils the plan and works out they know whatever the clue must be. Later that evening during a Henderson family performance Ernest is killed with a stab to the back. Petrified, Twelvetrees makes a hasty exit only to be pursued by Verity: she convinces him to come back after she reveals the true identity of his father and his place in his will: he is in line to take over his money, the house and its estates. Whilst confronting his uncles, Foster is told by Verity about the diamonds, their secret location and the fact he might be in possession of a clue to their location. Whilst he goes for the police Foster gets lost in the forest and eventually finds Patel: he tells him to go in his place. However, having taken some of his clothes, Patel is mistaken by the Henderson mother and she kills him as he walks through the woods.
Going back to the house, Foster meets up with Verity again to find Jessica – in possession of his framed motto – and Agnes dead by the snakehouse. Foster explains he received the motto in the post and Verity notices it's inaccurate. Explaining that it came with a birth certificate, Verity concludes the clue must be in his name. Foster goes to get it – learning his real name is Nigel Anthony Julian Amadeus Henderson – but comes back to Verity on the floor. Reggie walks in immediately and says she's dead. Foster, left alone, works out the clue: his initials form naja – a genus of snake, and he finds a package in the snake house. Confronted then by Stewart – Reggie having been killed in the interim – Foster refuses to hand it over and a violent chase ensues, but Foster traps Stewart with his mother. Downstairs, Foster is confronted by an alive Verity pointing a gun at him. She demands the diamonds and he unwraps the package, throwing the covering paper into the fire. However, the document inside reveals the covering paper was actually the map to the diamonds hidden in the estate, by the time they realize the map is already burned away. The film ends with Stewart, Verity and the Henderson mother being taken away in a police cart, whilst a camera shot moves away from Foster beginning to dig in the large grounds outside the house to find the diamonds.

British Horror Films called the film, "Very funny, very Hammer...and very, very good. Who says there's only ever been one successful Hammer-alike horror comedy ever produced? Carry On Screaming, you've got competition…"

Promontory Mountains
The Promontory Mountains are a range in Box Elder County, Utah. The range is oriented north-south and has a length of about 35 miles (56 km). The southern portion forms a cape extending 20 miles (32 km) south into the Great Salt Lake. The First Transcontinental Railroad was completed with the Golden Spike just north of the range at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory. Today, trains cross the Promontory Point at the southern tip of the range via the Lucin Cutoff railroad causeway across the lake.


== Geology ==
The Promontory Mountains are a block fault range typical of the Basin and Range Province. The west side of the range is bounded by the East Great Salt Lake normal fault which passes under the lake along the west side of Antelope Island and on to the south shore of the lake to the west side of the Oquirrh Mountains where it continues on strike as the Oquirrh Fault. The East Antelope Island fault runs from the east side of Antelope Island to the north beneath the lake to the east side of the Promentaries where it continues as the East Promontory Mountains fault zone. These two fault systems parallel the larger Wasatch Fault which runs to the east of Great Salt Lake. The faults are normal faults which dip to the west.


== History ==
The Promontory Mountains of 35 mi (56 km) were bypassed by the First Transcontinental Railroad (north) and the replacement 1904 Lucin Cutoff trestle through Promontory Point (south), which was replaced by a 1959 causeway.

The Music School of Rhodes (Μουσικό Σχολείο Ρόδου) is a school located on Rhodes Island in the Koskinou region of Greece, which specialises in teaching music. The current head teacher of the school is Theodora Tsimpouri. It opened in September 1993 with only 28 pupils and 10 teachers. At the end of summer 2013, the school was recorded to have a roll of 231 pupils and 68 teachers. The school is made up of 12 sections of which 8 are for pupils in the first 3 years of high school and 4 for the use of pupils in the last 3 years of high school. Although the school mainly specialises in music, other subjects are also taught to pupils such as maths, physics, literature and languages. The school is open from Monday to Friday between the hours of 08:00 to 3:15.


== History ==
The opening of the music school came about due to the demand for a music school from the Music School's Arts Committee (a department of the Education Ministry). When the school was founded in 1993, it had only 10 teachers: P. Giannakitsa (Philologist/Literature Teacher), T. Tsimpouri (Piano), E. xatzinikolaou (Piano), K. Loukas (Mathematician), B. Kattavenakis (Musician), H. Anastasiadis (Lyra), S. Perselis (Lyra), G. Paragios (Lyra), E. Statha (Piano), I. Dermitzakis (Violin) and N. Zervos (HeadMaster).
The announcement of the creation of the school received lots of negative reactions from the public. Many people felt uninterested or suspicious about the idea. Others were doubtful at the idea of a school which was so different from any other schools, specialising in one particular subject.


=== First Year ===
During the school's first year of operation, the school had problems regarding the housing of students. For the first few days of operation, the housing for the school was situated in Rodini park. However it was later transferred to the 6th Lykeio of Rhodes (also known as Ikokiriki). Conflict between the Music School of Rhodes and the admission of the 6th school of Rhodes caused the Music school to transfer to an area called 'Therme'.


=== Second Year ===
After the problems with the housing and conflict with the 6th school of Rhodes, the music school was eventually moving slowly back on track. During the second year of operation, the school building was divided into 3 sections for smoother running of teaching. In this case, there are 2 sections of the building that was provided to the first year pupils and the last section was allocated to the use of second years, since there were 46 1st year pupils and 25 2nd year pupils at the time. However, the housing problem was still one of the major issues to the school, owing to several numbers of insufficient classrooms, the teachers have spent most of their time teaching at the kitchen or in the yard if the condition allowed. In addition to the smooth running, more teachers have joined the School: M.Pavlidou, M.Sotiraki (Philologist/Literature Teacher), H.Xatzinikolaou (Physicist), G.Stintixaki (German Language), E.Volonaki (Piano), A.Santoriniou (Piano), E.Ioannidou, P.Kouvaras, G.Kotis, S.Xatzinikolaou, Xatzipapas (Theatre), T.Athanasopoulos (Art).


=== Third Year ===
As the time moved onto the third year of operation, the school has found the way to temporarily solve its housing problem. As a result, the location of the school was transferred from 'Therme' to “Gold Court” at Afantou area. As the school was into a more stable situation and the buildings was in good condition, the 4 sections of the building were allocated as 1 section for the 1st years, 2 sections for 2nd years (as there are more pupils) and finally 1 section for the 3rd years. As a success achievement of the year, the school won the 2nd award at the 1st PanHellenic music competition for their Byzantine Choir and 1st place in both piano and European Choir.


== Recent ==
The overall structure of the high school has been completed with the addition of 4th, 5th and 6th years, the school has gained support from EU funds for their new building at 'Asgourou' (which is their current location as of 2015). As a massive improvement at the end of the year the school has participated in the 2nd PanHellenic music competition and has taken four 1st places in different areas.


== Events ==
The music school regularly hosts events and festivals for the public to attend. The events that are held vary from operas to concerts. Other events are culturally themed such as the "Dancing and Singing in Asia minor" event. Another event which featured at the Music School of Rhodes Island was the "Music Stand" event which took viewers into Alexandros Papadiamantis' word of romantic short stories. The Music School of Rhodes also hold a music festival every year in which its students get to take part in the event.


=== Music Festival ===
The music school, along with the Department of the Dodecanese of the South Aegean Region and the Municipal Culture Sports Organisation of the Municipality of Rhodes (DOPAR), is set to be hosting a festival showcasing the Creation of Contemporary Music. The main purpose of the event is to allow young musicians to express themselves and show their talents by providing them with the best possible opportunity for expression. All that is required to allow students to perform at the festival is that they have passed the music audition before the festival begins. This festival is the 3rd of its kind following the success of the 2nd festival which was organised by the Region of Southern Aegean, Department of Culture, and took place in 2011.
The 2nd Festival of Contemporary Music Creation lasted 2 days and consisted of 25 bands, consisting of the Dodecanese, performing over the 2 days. The 1st festival, lasting only 1 day, brought 1000 spectators and the 2nd festival brought more than 1500 spectators over the 2 days it ran for. The reason as to why the music school itself was chosen to hold all 3 of the festivals is due to the fact that its location combines historical monuments and natural beauty providing the perfect backdrop to the festivals.
The 3rd festival of the Creation of Contemporary Music is divided into 3 phases. The 1st phase involves the students, who wish for their bands to participate, submitting applications for performing in the festival. The 2nd phase is where the bands are invited to the hearing in the Music School's auditorium where they perform in front of The Arts Committee of the festival. The committee then evaluate each band determining whether or not they reach the artistic criteria required to move on to the 3rd phase. The 3rd phase involves all of the groups who the Arts Committee determined suitable being given their performance slots. The Arts Committee use the 3 phases to achieve their goal in ensuring the hard working bands are able to go on to perform at the festival and showcase their talents.


== Other projects ==

The Ishkashim Important Bird Area, also spelt Ishkoshim, is a 1136 km2 tract of land in south-western Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province in eastern Tajikistan.


== Description ==
The site lies some 120 km south of the provincial capital of Khorugh, and 52 km from the district centre of Ishkashim, in the Shohdara Range of the southern Pamir Mountains. It encompasses a part of the southern slopes of the Shohdaras, the upper Vakhan valley, and the floodplain of the Panj River 10 km downstream from the confluence of the Pamir and Vahandara Rivers. There the Panj is braided, forming water meadows, pebbly shoals and sandy islands covered with tugay thickets.


== Birds ==
The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include Himalayan snowcocks, ferruginous ducks, saker falcons, Pallas's fish-eagles, cinereous vultures, ibisbills, European rollers, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's larks, wallcreepers, white-winged redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, rufous-streaked accentors, water pipits, fire-fronted serins, plain mountain-finches and crimson-winged finches.

Ad extirpanda (named for its Latin incipit) was a papal bull promulgated on Wednesday, May 15, 1252 by Pope Innocent IV which authorized in limited and defined circumstances the use of torture by the Inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics.


== Content ==
The bull was issued in the wake of the murder of the papal inquisitor of Lombardy, St. Peter of Verona, who was killed by a conspiracy of Cathar sympathizers on 6 April 1252. The bull argued that as heretics are "murderers of souls as well as robbers of God’s sacraments and of the Christian faith ...", they are "to be coerced—as are thieves and bandits—into confessing their errors and accusing others, although one must stop short of danger to life or limb."  The following parameters were placed on the use of torture:
that it did not cause loss of life or limb (citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum)
that it was used only once
that the Inquisitor deemed the evidence against the accused to be virtually certain.
The bull conceded to the State a portion of the property to be confiscated from convicted heretics. The State in return assumed the burden of carrying out the penalty. The relevant portion of the bull read: "When those adjudged guilty of heresy have been given up to the civil power by the bishop or his representative, or the Inquisition, the podestà or chief magistrate of the city shall take them at once, and shall, within five days at the most, execute the laws made against them."

Ad Extirpanda, English translation
Thomas J. "Tom" Peters (born November 7, 1942) is an American writer on business management practices, best known for In Search of Excellence (co-authored with Robert H. Waterman, Jr).


== Life and Education ==
Peters was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to Severn School a private, preparatory high school, graduating in 1960. Peters then attended Cornell University, receiving a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1964, and a master's degree in 1966.
He returned to academia in 1970 to study business at Stanford Business School receiving an M.B.A. followed by a PhD in Organization Behavior at the Stanford business school in 1977. The title of his dissertation was "Patterns of Winning and Losing: Effects on Approach and Avoidance by Friends and Enemies." Karl Weick credited Peters' dissertation with giving him the idea for his 1984 article: "Small wins: Redefining the scale of social problems." 
While at Stanford, Peters was influenced by Jim G. March, Herbert Simon (both at Stanford), and Karl Weick (at the University of Michigan). Later, he noted that he was influenced by Douglas McGregor and Einar Thorsrud.
In 2004, he also received an honorary doctorate from the State University of Management in Moscow.


== Career ==
From 1966 to 1970, he served in the United States Navy, making two deployments to Vietnam as a Navy Seabee, then later working in the Pentagon. From 1973 to 1974, he worked in the White House as a senior drug-abuse advisor, during the Nixon administration. Peters has acknowledged the influence of military strategist Colonel John Boyd on his later writing.
From 1974 to 1981, Peters worked as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, becoming a partner and Organization Effectiveness practice leader in 1979. In 1981, he left McKinsey to become an independent consultant.
In 1990, Peters was referred to in a British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) publication as one of the world's Quality Gurus.
In 1995, the New York Times referred to Peters as one of the top three business gurus in the highest demand as a speaker along with Daniel Burrus and Roger Blackwell.


=== In Search of Excellence ===
The publication of the popular business book In Search of Excellence in 1982 marked a turning point in Peters' career.
Peters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford in 1977, and returning to McKinsey, the new managing director, Ron Daniel, handed him a "fascinating assignment." Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's Boston Consulting Group, Daniel noted that businesses often failed to effectively implement new strategies, so Peters "was asked to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office."
In Search of Excellence was published in 1982. It became a bestseller, gaining exposure in the United States at a national level when a series of television specials based on the book and hosted by Peters appeared on PBS. The primary ideas espoused solving business problems with as little business-process overhead as possible, and empowering decision-makers at multiple levels of a company.
The December 2001 issue of Fast Company quoted Peters admitting that he had falsified the underlying data for In Search of Excellence. He is quoted as saying, " This is pretty small beer, but for what it's worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time."
In an odd turn of events, however, he later insisted that this was untrue, and that he was the victim of an "aggressive headline."


== Later Work ==
In later books Peters has encouraged personal responsibility in response to the "New Economy".
Peters's latest book is The Little Big Things, released in March 2010.
Peters currently lives in West Tinmouth, Vermont with his wife Susan Sargent, and continues to write and speak about personal and business empowerment and problem-solving methodologies. His namesake company is based in the UK.
