It has a 5-round rotary drum magazine. "ARWEN" is an acronym for "Anti Riot Weapon ENfield".\nIt was designed in 1977 by the British Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield, then part of the Royal Ordnance Factories. It came out of a British Military request for a multi-shot riot control weapon to replace the single-shot Federal Riot Gun. Three prototypes were designed and tested: one semi-automatic, one rotary-drum, and one pump-action. At the end of testing the rotary-drum model was put into production. The case has a rebated rim, so although the projectiles are comparable with other 37 mm riot control weapons, the loaded rounds are quite different.\nAs of 2001, all ARWEN trademarks and patents are owned by Police Ordnance Company Inc. The weapon is manufactured under license in Canada.\nSage Control Ordnance, Inc., located in Oscoda, Michigan has been producing less-lethal 37 mm Sage Rifled (ARWEN 37 compatible) munitions since the 1991 for law enforcement use only. Current production includes the following 9 munition variants:\nKO1 - Standard Impact Baton\nKO2 - CS Smoke\nKO3 - Irritant Impact Baton\nKO4 - White & Colored Screening Smoke\nBP5 - Irritant, Barricade Penetrating\nKO6 - Irritant, Muzzle Blast\nKO7 - Multi-Ball Area Impact\nKO8 - Soft Tip Impact Baton\nKO9 - Sub-caliber Training/Marking\nSage also produces a variety of projectile launchers chambered for 37 mm Sage Rifled (ARWEN 37 compatible) munitions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nARWEN ACE\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nBibliography\nBishop, Chris & Drury, Ian(November 1987).Combat Guns.London: Book Sales, ISBN 1-55521-161-5\n\n\n== External links ==\nPolice Ordnance product description\nArwen 37: info & image\nArwen 37T Tactical: info & image\nArwen 37S Shorty: info & image\nTypes of ammunition that ARWEN ACE & ARWEN 37 can fire\nHistory of the ARWEN 37\n[1]\nARWEN 37\nBig image, without magazine\nWith magazine', 'links': [u'.338 Lapua Magnum', u'.50 BMG', u'12 gauge shotgun', u'5.56\xd745mm NATO', u'7.62\xd751mm NATO', u'9\xd719mm Parabellum', u'ARWEN ACE', u'AT4', u'AW50F', u'Accuracy International Arctic Warfare', u'Assault rifle', u'Benelli M4', u'British Armed Forces', u'British Army', u'Browning Hi-Power', u'Caliber', u'Canada', u'Carbine', u'Carl Gustav recoilless rifle', u'Colt Canada C7 rifle', u'Designated marksman rifle', u'Enfield Town', u'FGM-148 Javelin', u'FN Minimi', u'Federal Riot Gun', u'Firearm', u'Glock', u'Grenade launcher', u'Heckler & Koch AG36', u'Heckler & Koch GMG', u'Heckler & Koch HK417', u'Heckler & Koch MP5', u'L115A1', u'L129A1', u'L16 81mm Mortar', u'L7 (machine gun)', u'L9A1 51 mm Light Mortar', u'LAW 80', u'M2 Browning', u'M6-640', u'M72 LAW', u'M82 Barrett rifle', u'MILAN', u'Machine gun', u'Missile', u'Mortar (weapon)', u'Non-lethal weapon', u'Outline of law enforcement', u'Pistol', u'Pump-action', u'Remington 870', u'Riot control', u'Rocket', u'Royal Ordnance Factories', u'Royal Small Arms Factory', u'SA80', u'SIG P226', u'Shotgun', u'Sniper rifle', u'Starstreak missile', u'Submachine gun', u'Tear gas', u'United Kingdom']}}
